          Rarity makes use of the Cardano blockchain to keep track of all the
          tokens minted using its services. Each Non-Fungible token created on
          Rarity is stored as a native token on the Cardano ledger, which is
          different than the traditional NFTs on other marketplaces that make
          use of Smart Contracts for minting. This native minting makes it
          extremely fast and cheap, where huge gas fees for minting NFTs using
          smart contracts is not required anymore in order to transfer NFTs. In
          addition, cardano plutus smart contracts are still put in use to make
          sure that all transactions and trades are automated and instantaneous.
        </p>
        <p id="reliable-market">
          Rarity's vision is to have a reliable marketplace that does not mess
          up its user's experience regarding minting, buying, and selling NFTs.
          We want to ensure that each time a user wants to buy an NFT and they
          have sufficient funds, then the NFT should go to them incase they were
          the first to get to that Buy button. We also ensure that no failing
          transactions would cost the users any money, since their experience
          and hard earned money are of extreme importance to us. Lastly, we
          promise a fair market that is empty from insider trading of NFT and
          prevent the use of bots to buy up certain awaited drops. Our most
          important goal is to have a fair market where everyone is treated
          equaly and each and every person has the same equal chances of making
          it big.
        </p>
        <p id="secure">
          Rarity is powered by Cardano and its use of a functional language
          called Haskell as a base. Rarity does not ask for the user to enter
          any private information or seed to a wallet and ensures that all
          private data of the user are not stored on its servers. Rarity does
          not handel the cryptocurrencies of the user and requires the user to
          connect his wallet to Rarity which enables the transactions without
          Rarity being a third party or involved in any means. This makes the
          transactions secure due to the nature of cryptocurrencies in general
          and how it is extremely difficult to hack and modify transcations.
        </p>
        <p id="transparent-team">
          Our team is devoted once again to make sure that the market is fair
          and that all users are treated equaly. This is the reason why make it
          a strict policy that all Rarity employees not trade on Rarity to
          ensure that no one is having insider sensitive information about
          certain NFT drops that are of great value and to aquire them at low
          prics before they hit the main marketplace of Rarity. This decision
          also helps ensure that no employee that has information about what
          drops will be featured on the home page in future times, would buy
          that drop since this would most certainly increase its value.
        </p>
        <p id="perks">
          Our users can take advantage of many perks such as price indicators to
          check whether the nft is undervalued or overvalued. It also shows the
          overall trends in the markets as well as many useful infromation to
          make trading decisions base on. In addition, our users will be opted
          in several free limited edition airdrops of tokens which may hold a
          lot of value in the future. Our platform and logic will be made open
          source and all our users will get the chance to vote on what features
          they want implemented and what features would they rather have changed
          or even removed.
        </p>
        <p id="fees">
          The minting fees are almost close to zero due to making use of the
          Cardano technology which is extremely advanced and uses the state of
          the art cryptography techniques. Buying and selling also takes little
          fees as much as 0.22 ADA which is not even close to a single US
          dollar. Rarity would like to keep its business model more focused on
          getting funds from donations to keep the wheel going and not bombard
          the users with extra fees, this is why we decided to only keep the
          fees of using our services at the tiny rate of 0.05% of each
          transaction made and did not add any fees for minting NFTs.
